# Patches

Patches in this directory are applied on top of the pinned Chromium commit
(`../CHROMIUM_COMMIT`) inside the local checkout.

## Conventions

1. Name files `0001-short-title.patch`, `0002-...`
2. List them in `series` in apply order
3. Prefer small, reviewable diffs that call into `aegis/` glue rather than rewriting Blink wholesale
4. Never vendor the full Chromium tree in this git repo

## Current local patch series

The status “in series” means only that the patch file is listed in the current local `series`; it does not mean that the patch has landed upstream, passed release gates, or is publishable. The 49-, 67-, and 95-patch records are retained only as historical snapshots. The current integrated source contains **116 Chromium patches plus 2 nested V8 patches**: 0057–0065 contain the original Browser Agent integration, 0066–0067 contain Settings/update and visual branding, and 0068–0108 replace and harden the v1 execution path with the Browser Agent v2 runtime, cross-platform entry points, scheduled automation, named-site routing, profile isolation, bounded recovery, browser-bound tab/document capabilities, correct product identity, off-UI-sequence persistence, deterministic teardown, and assertion-safe rate-limit handling. Patches 0109–0113 add and harden GitHub browser updates and product status/copy; patches 0114–0116 add access-route planning, trusted policy matching, and atomic Profile rule-store recovery contracts. Patches 0079–0095 replay to Chromium source commit `c930fa41ef7e9522f145848f3080ee0cc1edc4d8`; patches 0096–0101 produce `1c63ce994b2815fe1f3dc07608ff121d987e0441` (tree `451b3148d12fc2cff2df293cb0f1bb0d6242a908`); patch 0102 produces committed source `13807aaf086948bdff0370e356718d0c2ac54d27` (tree `4546f1afcabf38013ba9bef7e9e5d078ffd3ca77`). Artifact qualification remains platform-specific and requires acceptance evidence for that exact source.

Patches 0103–0105 replay exactly from the 0102 baseline to source tree `babd10e2e757d7b57f1b7ef18eac26ee5becc9cb` of commit `1e1341b51e3254d4638bc1917b140f30d4c1e9d7`. Real platform acceptance remains a separate gate.

Patch 0106 replays from that candidate to `383d157c6f3601101038aef6ff964e61b6af7b4f` (tree `2c509e07ec25fa8811adae17f9826e967c9bcee1`). This is a historical source checkpoint, not the current complete series.

The complete 108-patch series was replayed from the pinned base on 2026-09-10 to tree `319366182c31108e29e62d2f2199aff29a0b86e8`; both V8 patches were verified separately. See the [consolidation record](../../../docs/audit/main-consolidation-2026-09-10.md). This publication did not rebuild an App.

Apply with `pnpm --filter @gcsa-aegis/browser apply-patches` on a clean pinned checkout. Every series change requires a fresh offline replay, cold and incremental builds, and the affected tests.

# Chromium fork architecture

GCSA-aegis is a Chromium fork. The browser, network, storage, Blink, and selected V8 integration points are the product; there is no separate Extension or Electron deliverable.

## Status boundary

- Current Browser Agent v2 candidate: **108 top-level Chromium patches + 2 nested V8 patches**, replayed exactly to source tree `319366182c31108e29e62d2f2199aff29a0b86e8`.
- The 57-, 65-, 67-, 95-, and 97-patch records are historical snapshots and do not qualify the current v2 artifacts.
- Platform identity-bound builds and affected runtime acceptance remain open. There is no product-signed, notarized, installed, or published release.
- Android has not been built from the current source.

## Architecture principles

1. Policy models and generated inputs originate in `packages/core`.
2. Enforcement that requires browser or engine ownership lives in Chromium C++ and Blink.
3. Generated snapshots and the embedded policy worker bridge TypeScript policy into the fork.
4. User-facing settings live in native Chromium surfaces such as `chrome://aegis`, `chrome://downloads`, and `chrome://settings/downloads`.
5. Local evidence, a successful build, and a distributable release are separate states.

## Integration map

| Capability | Primary integration | Current boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Network and navigation | URL loader and navigation throttles | Requires fresh replay and representative browser regression |
| Storage protection | Cookie and bounce hooks | Must preserve expected first-party login behavior |
| Phishing protection | URL/page signals and native interstitial | Local detection does not establish universal coverage |
| Fingerprint protection | Blink Canvas, Audio, WebGL, and WebGPU hooks | Reduces selected stable surfaces; does not prevent all fingerprinting |
| Downloads | Chromium download UI plus isolated torrent service | HTTPS tracker support and release qualification remain gated |
| Page summaries | Heuristic path and user-configured compatible APIs | Remote use requires redaction and confirmation; Android page capture is unavailable |
| Browser Agent | Policy broker, fixed tool registry, Actor/side panel/WebUI, task store | Model cannot expand scope or bypass approvals; final purchase requires user takeover |
| 0079 primary Incognito | Exact-Profile Aegis/Agent/Actor/UI, memory-only state, and process-wide remote-CDP guard | Guest, System, and auxiliary OTR remain fail closed; completed downloads and approved bookmark writes retain Chromium persistence |
| MinerGuard | Browser/renderer signals and reporting | Observe-only; does not block execution or traffic |
| Bytecode shadow | Disabled-by-default nested V8 instrumentation | Research-only; exact source identity does not qualify distribution |
| Local automation | Loopback CDP controls and document authorization | Selected desktop paths have local evidence; signed-install and Android evidence are separate |

## Patch delivery model

`apps/browser/patches/series` orders the 108 Chromium patches. `apps/browser/patches/v8/series` orders the 2 patches applied in the nested V8 checkout. The replay script validates both bases before applying them.

`overlay/` records expected integration source for development and review. It is not independently applied and cannot replace the patch series. A source change must be exported to an ordered patch, replayed on the pinned base, built, and tested.

Patches 0057–0065 implement and harden Browser Agent v1. Patches 0066–0067 add tailored settings/update status and cross-platform branding. Patches 0068–0102 replace the v1 execution path with the Browser Agent v2 native hybrid runtime, novice entry points, model-first routing, scheduled automation, cross-platform integration, bounded read-only recovery, browser-bound tab/document capabilities, corrected GCSA Aegis identity surfaces, off-UI-sequence task persistence, bounded completion after same-origin rate limiting, and assertion-safe `Retry-After` handling. The 108-patch source passed exact chained replay; artifact identity remains platform-specific.

Being listed in a series proves only ordering and presence. It does not prove a clean replay, build freshness, signing, packaging, installation acceptance, Android support, or release approval.

## Summary and credential boundary

Desktop users may configure OpenAI-, Claude (Anthropic)-, or Gemini-compatible API formats with an explicit service URL. HTTPS is allowed; plain HTTP is restricted to numeric loopback addresses. API keys are optional and stored with operating-system encryption for the current profile.

Before a remote summary request, the browser prepares a redacted payload, performs a second validation, and shows the target format, model, and destination for confirmation. Sensitive pages and pages with password fields stay on the local heuristic path. Android cannot currently obtain a normal page tab for this workflow.

## Download boundary

HTTP(S) downloads remain Chromium `DownloadItem` operations. Metalink, Torrent, and Magnet jobs are integrated into the native downloads surface, while torrent work runs through an isolated service. Global connection settings and new-task defaults live in `chrome://settings/downloads`.

Video extraction, media conversion, FFmpeg, and a bundled download extension are outside this architecture.

## Platform and release boundaries

The non-component macOS Release build-tree is an input to release qualification, not the result. Full diagnostic patch coverage does not make it an RC. Publication additionally requires a clean committed root identity and trusted build evidence for both patch series, affected native and runtime tests, product identity, signing, notarization, packaging, install acceptance, and a passed release gate.

Android wiring exists in source, but there is no current-source APK or AAB. A supported x86-64 Linux build, device acceptance, Android page-summary behavior, and Play compliance remain open gates.

## Why not Electron

Electron does not own every Chromium network, CookieMonster, Blink, and V8 surface used by this design. The project therefore integrates at Chromium browser and engine layers while keeping all release claims behind explicit evidence gates.

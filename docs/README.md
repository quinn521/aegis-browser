This directory contains the public product architecture, roadmap, research boundaries, product page, and dated local audit records for GCSA-aegis.

> **2026-09-14 source update: UI corrections and browser updates：** The source now contains 113 top-level Chromium patches plus 2 nested V8 patches. Local macOS acceptance: Ver 1.1 (018), 32 findings addressed, 18 native tests and 116 UI checks passed; 170 changed messages and translation placeholders checked. Windows/Android device acceptance and a real Release installation remain unverified. No binary or tag is published with this source update. [018 验收记录](ui-copy-acceptance.zh-CN.md)

> **Historical boundary — 2026-09-10:** the Browser Agent v2 candidate source contains 108 top-level Chromium patches plus 2 nested V8 patches and replays exactly to Chromium source tree `319366182c31108e29e62d2f2199aff29a0b86e8`. Platform builds and acceptance remain separate gates; this source identity is not public-release qualification. Phase 2 remains a synthetic formal fixture, while Phase 3 is a 13-sample operator-blinded public pilot with recall `1/3`; neither generalizes to broad malicious-JavaScript detection. The project remains release No-Go.

## Status language

- **In source:** code or a patch exists; this is not build or runtime proof.
- **Source synchronized:** the repository overlay and patch stack match the external Chromium checkout.
- **Locally validated:** the named source, artifact, test, and runtime scope passed a recorded local gate.
- **Release-qualified:** identity, trust, signing, installation, platform, privacy, and distribution gates all passed for the same artifact. GCSA-aegis has not reached this state.

Do not add results from different patch heads. A historical App, APK, test count, or hash proves only the snapshot named by its record.

## Dated plans and audits

Files whose names include a date are evidence snapshots, plans, or implementation records. Their use of “current” refers to that record's date, not necessarily to the current repository head. Use [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for the current public status, and preserve the dated files as historical evidence rather than silently rewriting their measurements.

## Language convention

- English is the unsuffixed primary file shown by GitHub.
- Simplified Chinese uses `.zh-CN.md`.
- Traditional Chinese uses `.zh-TW.md`.
- Each public document begins with links to all three versions.
- Version numbers, dates, identifiers, hashes, commands, and evidence boundaries must remain equivalent across translations.

`product.html` is intentionally a single file with English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese switching built in.

## Source synchronization is not a release

The 2026-08-28 authorization permits SSH source synchronization to `git@github.com:gcsagroup/aegis-browser.git`. It does not authorize tags, GitHub Releases, binaries, packages, signing or notarization actions, Play uploads, or production deployment.
